# csv_llama3
This Python project enables natural-language queries over a structured dataset (CSV file) by integrating Pandas for data handling and Ollama’s LLaMA3 model for natural language understanding. The script loads a CSV file, converts it into text, and sends the data context to a locally running LLaMA model through Ollama’s REST API.
